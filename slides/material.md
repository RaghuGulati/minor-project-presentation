### Abstract
For some day scholors, the preferable mode to travel to college and then back to home is bus. For this reason, they prefer to apply for student bus pass. 


But the present system for applying for the bus pass is too time consuming because the students have to submit the required documents in various departments:
- Hostel Care Taker
- Mentor
- Department Clerk
- Academic Block (PG Block)
and wait for the verification. 

(The process mentioned is according to our college)
